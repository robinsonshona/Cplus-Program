Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client was The Gaming Room. They currently had a game called Draw It or Lost It for Android. The Gaming Room wanted to improve the software functionality and to expand to other platforms.They wanted me to create an OS that was compatible for other OS other than android. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe I divided the work and process of developing the document well. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I believe it aids in keeping my focus on the task at hand and to decide on what tasks are more important and which tasks don't need immediate time and focus.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Personally recomendations was the toughest part for me, I now know what is needed and why.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I took what the functionality of the game was and split the tasks into sections so that it would be easier expanding to other operating platforms. While  keeping the foundation of the game the same. Your client may be the one to ask you to do the work but it is the user's who truely control the product. If the product is not user friendly there is a high possibility the product will not last. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached the software by focusing on the documentation and seperating game and game needs functionality to allow easier updates and maintenence.
